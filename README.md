# VBA-challenge
I utilized the help of askbcs for the parts of the assignment that I got stuck on.
Although I spent many hours on this assignment, I could not get it to run through all worksheets and that is why I only included the screenshot of the first worksheet for the year 2018.
Thank you! 


4/15/2023 Update: I submitted my challenge a few days ago, before the deadline. However, I had a couple errors in it that I could not figure out. I had tutoring today because I want to understand the code and the improvements I could make before I move on to python. I am adding the "final version" files along with the original submission. Thank you
